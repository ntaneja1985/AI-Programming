# AI Programming in C#
- using ML.NET 

- We programmers create an artificial brain 
- We reward good answers and punish bad answers 
- We want an AI to distinguish between apples and oranges 
- We train it on 500 pictures of apples and oranges 
- ![alt text](image.png)
- We then show pictures and ask it to guess if the image is an apple or orange 
- This example is a subtype of AI called machine learning and it is an image classification algorithm 
- ChatGPT is a generative AI 
- It is trained on super large datasets.  
- Here AI program generates a response based on an input. 
- In AI there are subfields

- Other examples of AI are Alexa, Google Home and ChatGPT. 
- AI can also recognize emotions, however it cannot respond to them. 


## Main AI Concepts 

### Types of AI 
- Narrow AI and Strong AI 
- Narrow AI is used to perform specific tasks like an AI designed to play a game 
- Strong AI is a higher powered type of AI and can work on different types of tasks 

### Subtypes of AI

- #### Machine Learning
- In Machine Learning, we use data to train an AI model. After the model is trained, we present it with a situation and it makes a prediction based on its training. 
- Machine learning is of 3 types: 
- Supervised Learning , Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning
- **Supervised learning** is when we use labelled data to train our model to recognize patterns and predict outcomes 
- **Unsupervised learning** uses data without any labels, which the model uses to discover patterns that exist in the data and then uses the inferences to predict the outcome 
- In **Reinforcement learning**, we assign rewards and punishments to tasks to train the model, when then is able to make predictions using those results. 
- #### Classification 
- Another subtype of AI where the model puts data into different categories based on certain features it has 
- For example, we can classify words or sentences based on if they have a negative or positive emotion in them
- We can also classify images like grouping images of different fruits 
- Types of Classification are :
- **Binary Classification**
- This means we only have 2 categories: like Apples and Oranges
- **Multiclass Classification**
- More than 2 categories like Apples, Oranges and Banana
- **MultiLabel classification** 
- When the same type of data belongs to more than one category. For example if our program has categories: "nature" and "large", then mountains can belong to both these categories 
- Lot of classification algorithms 
- #### Regression 
- It is a strategy that plots all of the known data points and based on how the data is trending, it can predict future values. It allows us to see the relationship between 2 variables. 
- One variable on the X-Axis and One on the Y-Axis. 
- #### Forecasting 
- When an AI can predict future events 
- #### Recommendation 
- An AI strategy which is used to make suggestions based on prior choices. 
- If we viewed items on online store like books on Amazon's website and then seeing recommendations of similar items, that is an example of this type of AI 
- #### Neural Networks 
- ![alt text](image-4.png)
- They are like digital brains. We write code that enables the program to learn from its mistakes based on the way that the human brain works 
- Just like brain has neurons, neural network has perceptrons, which are the digital version of neurons. 
- By adding multiple layers of interconnected perceptrons, we are able to build a neural network that mimics the functionality of a human brain by sending signals between perceptrons. 
- #### Q-Learning 
- Type of reinforcement learning where a model will perform a task over and over and improve taking the correct action over time. 
- #### Deep Learning 
- Enables AI to recognize complex learning and is made possible thanks to neural networks. Examples are deep Q-Learning and Deep Convolutional Q-Learning.
